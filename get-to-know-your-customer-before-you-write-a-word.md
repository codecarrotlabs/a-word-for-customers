# Get to Know Your Customer Before You Write a Word

You’re not selling a product.

You’re not selling a service.

You’re not selling a solution.

An app. A pair of shoes. A device. A SaaS plan. An upgrade.

Here’s the only thing you’re selling, no matter what business you’re in and what you ship: **you’re selling your prospects a better version of themselves**.

When you do that effectively, you sell better. Your conversion rate increases. People share stories about you and their experiences with your solution. Life gets easier. For everyone.

But in order to sell your prospects a better, happier version of themselves, you need to put down your pen, step away from your keyboard, stop actively thinking about your solution… and **get to know the Helsinki outta your visitors, customers and prospects**.

In the first edition of this book, we took a little while to get to this point. But it is, in fact, your thesis as a copy hacker. Your job is not to write copy. Your job is to know your visitors, customers and prospects so well, you understand the situation they’re in right now, where they’d like to be, and exactly how your solution can and will get them to their ideal self. Your job is, from that point, to sell your prospect a better version of himself or herself.

I’ll teach you how to do that.

## Your Best Messages Don’t Come from Inside Your Head

 The reason I believe every startup founder can write their own copy is because the best  converting copy doesn’t actually come from a copywriter. Or a so-called wordsmith. Or a  content creator. You don’t need to be a copywriter to write a very solid draft of your web or email copy.

That’s because, as you’re going to see throughout this ebook, the best messages – the ones that help you sell your prospects a better version of themselves – come from the people who have bought or are likely to buy your solution.

Take the raw statements they share.

And use them verbatim.

Or tweak them using the techniques you’ll learn in the Copy Hackers ebooks.

When you get inside your prospect’s head by using his/her words, you get much closer to understanding what their “better version” of themselves looks like. When you stay in your own head, you only know what happiness means to you. It might be different for them. So get out of your head – and start maniacally stalking, in the most legal ways, your prospects.

## First, Who’s Your Target Market \(or Market Segment\)? 

Before you can start studying what your prospects have to say, you might want to figure out who they are in the first place.

Who’s your target market? Do you know? How _sure_ are you?

When building a photo-sharing solution, you may think your target market is the early adopter tech group out there, the ones who’ll up-vote your “We Just Launched” blog posts on Hacker News. And you may be right. So you may think you should target your messages at tech geeks…

But how long will that market use your site?

How likely will they be to refer your site to influential people or to the masses?

**People who won’t derive enough value to talk about your product after using it are not your target audience.** Let them sign up if they want to. But don’t work at acquiring them. It’s not worth it. They’ll barely use your solution; they’ll never tell anyone about it; and they’ll make you work yer butt off for the sheer pleasure of serving them. Which sucks.

Now ask yourself, and be hard on yourself: **Do I really know who my target customer is?** 

With a little research, you may find that the prevailing users of your photo-sharing site will be teenage girls, teenage “EMO” boys, new moms, retired women. Will the messages that work on a tech-geek group work on those groups? Unlikely. What matters to those groups? TBD. Once you figure out your primary target market\(s\), you can delve deeper to find out the details that flesh out these faceless, nameless “markets”.

How can you do this research, you ask?

Great question. That question brings us to the gold of this book, the gold in any copy hacker’s treasure chest, the gold that is research and discovery.

* **If you have an email list \(i.e., for lead gen, for pre-launch signups\), send them a short survey requesting info.** Ask them about themselves – and ask them what interests them in your service. HINT: If you actually ask people to please do you a favor – use the word “favor” – your response rates can increase. Adding “please” can only help. I’ve seen it. Test it to prove me right.
* **Go out there and TALK to people.** I’m amazed by how frequently startups with zilch dollars think they need to hire a consulting firm to hold a focus group and generate some useless report. Focus groups are, like, 8 people. Can you not go to a coffee shop and annoy 8 people? Hell, you could give ‘em all $25 gift cards for their time and still save tons o’ cash vs. actually holding a focus group. Plus, you’ll get to have real conversations – and conversations stick much better than a bunch of data in some report. Oh, and let’s not forget that focus groups often lead to the very ugly “groupthink”, where a dominant personality in the group can sway others to agree with her… leaving you with skewed, useless data. Blech. Not good.
* **Stay in your office and TALK to people.** Okay, to be honest, I don’t like going out and talking to people. I do it a lot, but rarely by choice. I’d much rather converse with people online, from the comfort of my own desk. So, if you’re like me, get involved in forums. That does NOT mean spamming forums – showing up, splashing news about your pending launch, and then high-tailing it. That means listening to what your potential customers are talking about, and engaging them when/if it will be mutually beneficial.

You also need to figure out the demographic details for your target markets or segments. Knowing the vital statistics for your markets, where they live and more can help you break 7 your markets into segments. And knowing target _segments_ can really help you shape your language – so you can get specific \(which is better than generic\).

You’ll want to learn their: 

* Age
* Gender
* Marital status
* Number of children
* Education
* Annual income
* Disposable income / budgets
* Favorite websites
* Favorite pastimes
* Device usage

You’re not just learning this stuff so you can shove it into a report and dust your hands of it. We’re not MBAs, after all. We’re copy hackers. We’re self-funded startup founders and marketers that need ROI on everything we spend our precious time on. So what can you do with demographic data? How can that help you craft your message?

Well, married men over the age of 35 with 2 children and a Master’s degree may be made ‘happy’ by something different from what would make retired divorcees with grown children and a dependency on their RSP / 401K happy. Both could want a boat. But the people in that boat and the duration of trips taken with that boat will be quite different. You wouldn’t want to treat these two groups the same in your web copy or art.

## Next, Narrow Your Market into Manageable Segments

Unless you’re planning to disrupt a major existing business – like Expedia or the MLS – you may not want to try to market to a wide range of people. Instead, you’ll want to segment your market to determine whom to focus your energy on.

That is, **you want to choose the segment that will visit your site with the most frequency and be most likely to compensate you in some way for your service** – whether that compensation is actual money paid to you, referrals sent your way, or new users brought into your fold.

These segments are the people you are writing copy for.

These segments are the people who are most likely to become your customers.

They may not be glamorous and they may not be rich. But if they have the money to spend on your product and the network of friends to refer to your service, then they are the new cornerstone of your business.

Know them like your spouse. No, _better_.

### Example: Messaging for Moms

If you’re writing copy for your photo-sharing site, and you know your visitors are primarily married young stay-at-home moms without post-secondary education, under $55K in annual household income, $20K in credit-card debt, and 0.8 devices per member of the household, you’ll probably steer your messages towards how _affordable_ your solution is. And probably steer them away from ease, knowing that this market is at ease with technology in general.

And if you know these young moms generally have smart phones with apps to keep their kids busy in the back of the Dodge Caravan while they drive to and from the grocery store because they only hire a babysitter on date night or Girls’ Night Out, then you might offer a free or low-cost game-style app to win their loyalty. You might even put a link to download that app front-and-center on your home page.

### Example: Messages for Career-Oriented Women

On the other hand, if you learned that your primary target segment was middle-aged career-oriented women with low consumer debt, high household income, and a propensity toward visiting Oprah.com and lending on Kiva, would you talk about how affordable your solution is? Not if you want results. In fact, you might adjust your pricing – and messaging – strategy to play into the idea that _high prices equal better solutions for this group_.

Do you see how knowing your market will shape your primary messages and even your positioning as a brand? This is not to be glossed over. It will impact your conversion rate.

**There are 100s of different messages out there for this reason: each segment has values and motivations that only a few messages will meet.**

You can’t reach your hand into the grab bag of messages and use whatever you pull out.

You need to target _specifically_.

## It’s Hard to Be Your Best Self If You’re in Pain…

At a high level, there are 2 sides to crafting a message:

1. Targeting pain
2. Reflecting motivation, including a desire to derive value

Your product needs to neutralize or eradicate a critical pain for your market or market segment… or to pinpoint one of their key motivations.

**Let’s start with pain.** Find out what the pains are that your target customer experiences and that you can solve. Here are some ways you can start to uncover pains:

* Ask yourself, **what keeps my customers up at night?**
* Audit your competitors’ sites to see what pain points they hit on
* Test PPC ads with certain pain points in them to see which get clicked most often
* Monitor people in your ideal customer segment on Twitter and/or in their blogs to see what pains they mention

Once you know the pains your customers feel, you can start thinking through how your solution addresses or eradicates those pains. And use that very useful information in your copywriting.

**Now on to the topic of motivation,** which is what great marketing campaigns remind people of and further instill in people. “Motivation” is the driving force behind the actions we take. When a user comes to your site, they are motivated to do so – motivated by forces that live outside the virtual walls of your virtual store.

You cannot create motivation on your site.
